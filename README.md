# geography-quiz
 A website to allow users to test and grow their geography skills.

# Features I want to add
 - Add a play button that obscures the map before starting the quiz
 - Learning pages, or a "here's a country, enter it in" type quiz
 - Fix Europe default zoom & label size
 - Disable double-click to zoom on the chart?
